Short Bias Note on representativeness of Titanic passengers

The Titanic dataset exhibits several sampling biases that affect its representativeness. There is significant class imbalance, with third-class passengers being overrepresented in the passenger list but having systematically different characteristics and outcomes compared to higher classes. Gender representation is skewed in survival rates, reflecting the evacuation protocols rather than natural population distributions. Age distribution is uneven, with certain age groups having substantially different survival patterns. The dataset also contains missing information patterns that are not random, particularly for variables like Age and Cabin, which correlate with passenger class. These biases mean that models trained on this data may learn patterns specific to these structural inequalities rather than generalizable relationships. The dataset represents a specific snapshot with inherent sampling limitations that must be considered when interpreting analytical results or making generalizations beyond this specific passenger population.
