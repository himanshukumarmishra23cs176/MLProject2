The Titanic dataset contains passenger information from the 1912 maritime disaster, with features including class, demographics, family relationships, and fare information. The target variable is survival status, creating a binary classification problem.

Key assumptions include: missing data mechanisms are consistent across the dataset, feature relationships remain stable in prediction contexts, and historical patterns maintain predictive relevance for similar scenarios. We assume engineered features like family size and cabin availability meaningfully relate to survival outcomes.

Known biases significantly impact analysis: class distribution shows overrepresentation of third-class passengers with systematically different survival rates. Gender bias reflects evacuation protocols rather than natural distributions. 

Age-based survival patterns show uneven representation across groups. Missing data (particularly Age and Cabin) correlates strongly with passenger class, creating non-random gaps. The dataset represents a specific historical snapshot with limited generalizability to modern populations or different disaster scenarios, and excludes crew members entirely while potentially underrepresenting certain nationalities.
